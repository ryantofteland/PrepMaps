<tr>
      <td class="left"> Lineage  </td>
      <td colspan="4" class="right"> The Land Management Information Center (LMIC, now MnGeo) created this data set for the Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) of the Minnesota Department of Education to help MDE determine eligibility status in the FNS food programs. <br> <br>In 1998-99, LMIC provided maps to school districts and asked the districts to locate school buildings.  LMIC then digitized these points and added the school names that appeared on the maps to the database.  In order to add the ID used by CFL, LMIC obtained the public school database from the CFL webpage, rawdata.html, on 6/19/99.  It contained 2192 school site records.  The schools that were digitized from the maps were matched to the records in the public school database.  For those records that did not match any point, a point location was determined.  A variety of methods were used to locate these records including phone calls to the schools and address matching. <br> <br>Note that these CFL records are for school programs and not school buildings.  Multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points.  For example, a K-6 program and an alternative learning center, or a junior and a senior high school, may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and ID in the CFL database.  They will, therefore, have separate points in the data layer.  The records cover traditional K-12 programs as well as alternative learning centers and other special programs. <br> <br>As part of the FNS project, the school districts have been asked each year to provide any changes to the educational facilities. The changes may include elimination of schools no longer in service, the addition of new schools and the correction of the schools' locations. The school districts mainly have provided changes to the traditional K-12 program locations. <br> <br>Each year, LMIC made the changes provided by the school districts to the point file (the work for SY2002-2003 started with the SY1999-2000 database). In addition, the CFL public school database was retrieved from the CFL web site. All of the programs that matched by the ID_STRING to this database were identified. For the traditional K-12 programs, the attributes such as ID, address, school class and grades were compared to the CFL database. If there were any new traditional K-12 programs which were not provided by the school districts, a point location was determined and added to the data layer. All other programs that did not match to the CFL database were deleted. One should note that the CFL public school program database changes throughout the school year and other program changes could have occurred that are not reflected in these databases. <br> <br>Work was not done to change any locations to programs not used by the FNS project or not identified by the school districts as a new or changed location.  This includes any programs that may been originally located based on the same address as one of the traditional K-12 programs and subsequently that K-12 program location was edited. <br> <br>SY2002-2003 SUMMARY: <br>The PUBSCH03 point file is a fairly complete representation of the traditional K-12 public schools programs. The school districts have had the most input in providing, correcting and updating these locations, although there may still be some positional problems not yet identified. <br> <br>SY2003-2004 SUMMARY: <br>Each year LMIC has sent a large format School District map (36 inches x 52 inches) to each school district. For SY2003-04, LMIC also included a larger scale map for each school in the District. By adding these larger scale maps, school administrators were able to more accurately mark the locations of each school. <br> <br>SY2004-2005 SUMMARY: <br>Three attributes were added:  (LEVEL, SCH_TYPE, SCH_TYPE1) and one attribute name was changed (CFL_ID_STRING was changed to ORGID). <br> <br>SY2005-2009 SUMMARY: <br>School locations were modified according to 2003 NAIP aerial phography from the Farm Service Agency:  <a href="http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip03.html" target="_blank"> http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/metadata/naip03.html</a> . Each location was moved to match the photographic location. <br> <br>SY2009-2010 SUMMARY: All school locations were brought into the same geodatabase spatial file. Locations were checked using prior methods. Differentiation of schools is made through reselection based on SCH_TYPE and SCH_TYPE1 or by UNI_TYPE attributes. <br> <br>SY2010-2011 SUMMARY: Modified dataset using MDE's ORGUNIT school database. Added county code number. </td>

Aerial photography was used as a background data layer.

The first 2 digits are Minnesota's state number (27). The next 5 digits are the District school designation. This will be the same for each school in that district. The final 5 numbers are the school identifier. <br> <br>Example: Aitkin School District <br>   Office              01 0001 000 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760              (2702760) <br>   Aitkin High      01 0001 001 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760 00057   (270276000057) <br>   Rippleside El.  01 0001 002 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760 00059   (270276000059) <br>   Palisade El.     01 0001 003 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760 00058   (270276000058) <br> <br>   City Academy Charter  (District)  01 4000 000 000 FED_SCHNUM=27 08955             (2708955) <br>   City Academy Charter  (School)  01 4000 010 000 FED_SCHNUM=27 08955 00016  (270895500016) <br> <br>SCH_LEVEL - Attempt to identify those programs that are a 'District' level program versus 'School' level. Used mainly within the Minnesota Department of Education. 'District' identification has NO UNI_IMD or UNI_MNR, meaning the last six numbers will be '000000'. This designation only has a UNI_TYP or UNI_MAJ designated number. Main examples are: <br> <br>1. School district offices have an ORGID of '000000' at the end because of the District designation. Examples  Minneapolis (030001000000), Fridley (010013000000) or St. Paul (010625000000). <br> <br>2. Charter schools - Charters are their own district, therefore there is a location for each charter license that is '000 000'. There may be 2, 3, 4 or more locations based on the charter but there will always be 1 record for each charter with these numbers. The charters may also be housed on a single location or in several locations. Examples: <br>   <br>   Metro Deaf (District)  07 4000 000 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul <br>   Metro Deaf (School)  07 4000 010 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul <br>   Metro Deaf (School)  07 4000 020 000, 1471 Brewster St., St. Paul <br> <br>   Nova Classical Academy (District)             07 4098 000 000, 426 Osceolo Ave., St. Paul <br>   Nova Classical Academy Lower (School)  07 4098 000 000, 1668 Montreal Ave., St. Paul <br>   Nova Classical Academy Upper (School)  07 4098 000 000, 426 Osceolo Ave., St. Paul <br> <br>There are other schools with a 'District' designation but District offices and Charter schools are the majority. To reselect all Charter schools by District you would use this identifier to reselect only those. If you want all charters but not the District designation, just locations, then reselect OUT the District designation. </td>
